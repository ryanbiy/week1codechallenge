#Project Title
Speed Detector

#Project Description
This JavaScript function takes in the speed of a car and calculates the number of demerit points incurred based on the speed. If the speed is within the allowed limit of 70 km/h, the output will be "Ok". If the speed exceeds the limit, the output will be the number of demerit points incurred, and if the number of demerit points exceeds 12, the output will be "License suspended".

#Project Setup
Copy the code from the speedgenerator.js file into your JavaScript project.
Call the carSpeed function and pass in the speed of the car as an argument.
The function will return the result as a string output.
