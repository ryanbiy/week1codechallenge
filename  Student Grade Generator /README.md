#Project Title
Student Grade Generator

#Project Description
This is a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade as follows: 
A > 79, B > 60 to 79, C > 59 to 49, D > 40 to 49, E > less 40.

#Project Setup
Copy the code from the gradegenerator.js file into your JavaScript project.
